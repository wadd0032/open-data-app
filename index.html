	<h2>A Project Brief</h2>
	
	<h1>An Open Data App for City of Ottawa Community Gardens</h1>
		<p>The City of Ottawa has compiled an open data file of community gardens in the municipal area. Community gardens are exploding in popularity in North American municipalities, likely due to the many social benefits arising from such programs. Many community gardens help restore native plant populations and landscape, thereby improving neighbourhood aesthetics and ecology, but emphasis is usually placed on food production. Consequently, community gardens help increase the food security of urban populations, and sometimes help supply non-profit organizations with a local food source to help feed low-income groups. Community Gardens also decrease the amount of greenhouse gases generated during the transportation of food, and may strengthen people’s connection to both nature and their communities and decrease crime in the area (active communities = less crime and vandalism). Such gardens also help improve the health of citizens by increasing vegetable consumption and levels of physical activity.</p>

	<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>The proposed open data app would assist the population to find the locations and details of community gardens, and would help promote the adoption of a program that is very advantageous to the community as a whole. Citizens could find a community garden in their area and sort the gardens alphabetically, or based on a rating system generated by users of the app.</p>

	<h3>Features</h3>
		<p>The declared attributes of the data set supplied by the City of Ottawa <a href="http://ottawa.ca/online_services/opendata/info/community_gardens_en.html" rel="external">(click here)</a> include the name of a community garden and its legal address. This information will be used to generate a list of gardens in the Ottawa area.</p>
		<p>The first public screen—the “home” page—will enable the user to find a community garden based on the location parameters they key into the search field. The listings can then be displayed alphabetically, on the garden’s proximity to the user’s location, or ranked according to the rating given the garden.</p>
		<p>A Google map will be displayed to the right of the list where an icon for every community garden in the municipal area will be displayed, indicating the locations of these gardens.</p>

		<p>The user may then select a garden from the list, which will cause a dialogue box to pop-up from that garden’s location on the map. This “Info” box will provide further details about the garden’s location, possible contact information and the rating.</p>
		<p>Clicking on the name of the garden in the pop-up dialogue box will take the user to a second public page, a single page, which will provide more specific information about that particular community garden:</p>
			<ul>	
				<li>the distance of the garden from the user’s location</li>
				<li>comments from the “Disqus” forums</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The secondary page will also display the rating interface users may use to rate the garden, thereby affecting the current average rating.</p>
		<p>There are other aspects to a community garden that users might find it useful to know. Such information might include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the organizational model of the garden;</li>
				<li>the type of plants that may be grown there;</li>
				<li>whether it’s broken into common areas where the upkeep is shared, or individual plots, or a combination thereof;</li>
				<li>if a particular garden donates any of the resulting produce to non-profit organizations; or</li>
				<li>if there is any fee.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Unfortunately, being unable to inspect the data file, it is unclear if there is any additional information included—besides the name and address—that may be used to flush out the secondary page.</p>
		<p>In terms of administration of the app, there will be password-protected options to add and/or delete community gardens from the list, as well as to edit any of the information about a particular garden.</p>
		<p>Finally, the app will be designed to be responsive, so that it may flexibly adapt to a variety of mobile devices and computer displays while loose none of the visual appeal or funtionality.

	<h3>User Persona</h3>
		<p>The likely user of the proposed app would be a citizen of the municipality of Ottawa interested in gardening—either an avid, experienced gardener or a newcomer to the hobby who’s interested in trying it out—who does not have access to their own plot of land. They might be a citizen living a condo or apartment-type situation, who wants to garden, but whose residence doesn’t give them access to land for such a purpose. The user could be a senior who used to have his or her own garden, but has since moved into a smaller residence. A prospective user, in addition to the need for a plot of land, may also be motivated by the desire to be more involved in their community, by environmental concerns, or by charitable intentions (e.g., growing fresh produce for food banks). They may also be motivated by personal goals, like adding fresh produce to their diet or being more physically active.</p>
